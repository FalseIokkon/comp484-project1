        <dt id="rubber"><strong>Rubber Information</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Rubbers are incredibly unique and vary more than most would imagine. Rubbers come in two main
          categories: inverted and pimpled. Inverted rubbers than have their own sub-categories such as regular,
          tacky, hybrid, and more. Pimpled rubbers also have their own sub-categories and mainly fall under short, medium,
          and long pimpled rubbers. Each type of rubber completely changes the feel and response of the ball when hit, as well
          as provides opportunities for unique playstyles. The current most popular rubber amongst professional players is the DHS
          Hurricane rubber series.

        <dt id="blades"><strong>Blade Information</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Blades are the foundation of every table tennis racket and play just as important a role 
          as the rubbers. They are typically made of multiple layers of wood, sometimes combined 
          with carbon or other synthetic fibers to enhance speed and stability. Blades are often 
          categorized by their playing style: defensive, all-round, and offensive. Defensive blades 
          are slower and offer maximum control, while offensive blades are built for speed and power. 
          The number of plies (layers) also affects performance, with 5-ply blades favoring control 
          and 7-ply or composite blades offering more aggression. Choosing the right blade is highly 
          personal, as its weight, handle shape, and flexibility all influence how a player feels and 
          performs on the table.
